Finding out where and when Community Matters!

The readme file is a place to keep the project description and a list of the goals of the analysis, including code to achieve those goals.

Project overview:
Overall research question:
The purpose of this study is to fully examine our dataset from 13 burned areas located across the western US to address emerging questions regarding ecosystem trajectories and transformation following severe fire in dry pine mixed conifer forests. The particular focus here is on how plant community affects post-fire seedling establishment, and determine whether community effects vary across local and regional climate gradients using the Stress Gradient Hypothesis as an anchor.

The stress gradient hypothesis posits that facilitation relationships will be more common in stressful environments, and that these convert to competitive relationships in more productive/benign environments. Stress gradients may be linear or curvilinear. Amelioration of a given stressor is probably maximized at moderate stress rather than at extreme levels. Particular topical in the context of climate change, thinking about water stress and temperature stresses.
